# Azure AI Image Analysis Project

#### This project is inspired by Microsoft's challenge project for adding image analysis and generation capabilities to an application (found here). One major difference between Microsoft's challenge project and this project is that Microsoft's version utilizes a React app while this application utilizes C# .NET and Razor.

To set up environment: 
- Open Docker Desktop
- Open project in Visual Studio Code, click 'Open a Remote Window' in bottom right corner, and click 'Reopen in Container'
- Run 'dotnet watch' in terminal to start hot-reload server for Razor web application

Technology stack and dev tools used:
- C# .NET 8.0
